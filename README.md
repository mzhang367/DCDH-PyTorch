# Overview
![method illustration](/images/dcdh_framework.png)
<br>
Illustration of DCDH framework. ***Î¸***, ***M***, ***B***, and ***W*** represent the network parameters, class centers, binary hashing codes, and regression matrix, respectively. The proposed dual constraint on class centers aims to pull intra-class samples to the corresponding class center while pushing pairwise centers as far as possible. By ***W***, ***B*** is mutually determined by the hashing layer output and labels information. The arrows between every two modules show the information forward/backward-propagation.

# Prerequisites
- Python >=3.6
- PyTorch >=1.2
# Data
We directly use the same data of FaceScrub and YouTube Faces datasets as released by [DDH](https://github.com/xjcvip007/DDH). For your convenience:
- YouTube Faces

 Training: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Of-hUKhQhk3OtCUAZc15pZqEvKHWNUpN
 
 Test: https://drive.google.com/open?id=10RuxZuIMfvPN6ziPglJTgS6IWFBzW3pW
 - FaceScrub

 # Trained Model
 We release the trained models on two datasets: FaceScrub and YouTube Faces under four different code lengths {12, 24, 36, 48}, respectively. The models are named following the rule of "dcdh_\[*dataset*]\[*length*].tar" and can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=152TYljUGI4tDdJJhtjDr9bVLYRxuDK5n).
 
 # Usage
 ## Training
 Assuming the dataset path `./FaceScrub` is under the same directory as the `dcdh_train.py`, to train the model by yourself, simply run the following command:
 ```
 python dcdh_train.py --dataset facescrub --save your_model_name.tar --len 48
 ```
This will train the 48-bit hashing model on the dataset FaceScrub with the default configurations of hyper-parameters, which are the same as written in the paper. The model will be saved under the folder `./checkpoint` in default. To see help for the training script:
 ```
 python dcdh_train.py -h
 ```
 
 ## Evaluation
 We provide various of commonly-used evaulation metrics including mean average precision (mAP), precision and recall under Hamming distance 2 and the precision curve w.r.t. Hamming ranking. Suppose your model for evaluation is under the default folder `./checkpoint`, simply execute:
 ```
 python evaluation.py --load model_name_on_youtube_12bit.tar --dataset youtube --len 12
 ```
